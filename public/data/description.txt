Create a small Symfony + Angular app for orders management (using data from orders.json)

Requirements:

1. Fetch orders from backend and show them in a <table>
  You can use the JSON file as data source so you won't have to create a database

2. Add pagination (10 orders/page)

3. Allow users to cancel an order (including the backend code)
  The final part - when the data should pe saved - can be skipped.

4. Use DDD design pattern for backend logic
